# **ol-photon** project

It's a direct port of Leaflet-photon code available at https://github.com/komoot/leaflet.photon

The Leaflet demo is in production for the French BAN (Base Adresse Nationale), a database dedicated to French adresses.
You can see it in action at http://adresse.data.gouv.fr/map/

For the OpenLayers 3 project, we changed some parts and although we didn't try it in other projections, it should work with any projections.

We made the component so you can choose to use it with any map libraries like OpenLayers or MapLibre or simply outside without any map part.

You can see multiples demos in action:

- [with Openlayers](https://rawgit.com/webgeodatavore/photon-geocoder-autocomplete/master/demo/index-ol.html)
- [with MapLibre](https://rawgit.com/webgeodatavore/photon-geocoder-autocomplete/master/demo/index-maplibre.html)
- [without a map](https://rawgit.com/webgeodatavore/photon-geocoder-autocomplete/master/demo/index-no-map.html)
